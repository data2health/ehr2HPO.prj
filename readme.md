# HPO 2 EHR

## Problem statement

This tool converts FHIR/LOINC encoded laboratory test results as HPO codes; here we extend the conversion to other phenotype sources in the EHR.

## Project description

Please see our preprint [Semantic Integration of Clinical Laboratory Tests from Electronic Health Records for Deep Phenotyping and Biomarker Discovery](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519231v1?rss=1) for background about this project.

In the next six months, we will follow a series of steps to harden the code, test it in one CTSA setting, and develop a multi-CTSA site project that will utilize our software library to perform EHR-driven research.

## Education
````
See [education.md](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/education.md) for details. Each project should have Education-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "education" tag. 
````
## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

````
We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".
