# HPO 2 EHR

## Problem statement

This tool converts FHIR/LOINC encoded laboratory test results as HPO codes; here we extend the conversion to other phenotype sources in the EHR.

## Project description

Please see our preprint [Semantic Integration of Clinical Laboratory Tests from Electronic Health Records for Deep Phenotyping and Biomarker Discovery](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519231v1?rss=1) for background about this project.

In the next six months, we will follow a series of steps to harden the code, test it in one CTSA setting, and develop a multi-CTSA site project that will utilize our software library to perform EHR-driven research.
